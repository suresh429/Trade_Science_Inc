UV-Visible, elemental and spectral analysis. The absorption spectra properties of such selected dyes were investigated in 95% Ethanol to attempt and throw some light on the influence of such new heterocyclic nuclei and to compare or evaluate spectral behaviors. The solvatochromic behavior and colour changes of some selected newly synthesized cyanine dyes are observed in solvents having different polarities. This permits a selection   of optimal solvent (fractional solvent) when such dyes are applied as photosensitizers. The spectral behavior of some selected cyanine dyes in mixed solvents of different polarities has been studied to estimate number of hydrogen bond formed between the solute &amp; solvent molecules and to allow measurement of certain energies such as hydrogen bonding, orientation and free energies.<\/p>","page_num":"","date":"2018-07-03","vol":"14","issue":"2","rel_keyword":"articles","journal_shortname":"Org Chem Ind J"},{"sno":"13748","access_type":"open access","title":"Synthesis and Characterization of Grafted SH-Functionalized Tripodal Ti-POSS Complex in Gold Nanoparticles as a Selective Epoxidation Catalyst","author_names":"Emad Aish H, Waleed Boraie E and Abdelwahed Sayed R","abstractlink":"synthesis-and-characterization-of-grafted-shfunctionalized-tripodal-tiposs-complex-in-gold-nanoparticles-as-a-selective--13748.html","pdflink":"https://www.tsijournals.com/articles/","fulltextlink":"https://www.tsijournals.com/articles/synthesis-and-characterization-of-grafted-shfunctionalized-tripodal-tiposs-complex-in-gold-nanoparticles-as-a-selective-epoxidation-catalyst-13748.html","fullname":"Organic Chemistry: An Indian Journal","journal":"tsoc","domain_name":"http://www.tsijournals.com/","art_type":"Review","abstract":"<p>Herein we described an easy and efficient method for preparation and grafting of SH-functionalized tripodal Ti-POSS complex in gold nanoparticles  supported in SiO2 and obtained a hybrid material that possess two important features.

In this context we present a model for computational prediction of the synthetic accessibility (SA) using four weighted molecular descriptors, representing different structural and topological features, combined by an additive scheme. The components of SA modeling function are examined and the results from the comparison of our model with data from other methods are presented.  The method for theoretical prediction of SA is implemented within open source software tool Ambit-SyntheticAccessibility (Ambit-SA).<\/p>","page_num":"","date":"2018-06-30","vol":"14","issue":"2","rel_keyword":"articles","journal_shortname":"Org Chem Ind J"},{"sno":"13598","access_type":"open access","title":"Zika Virus (ZIKV) - An Uncommon Zoonotic Virus","author_names":"Bishnu Parida","abstractlink":"zika-virus-zikv--an-uncommon-zoonotic-virus-13598.html","pdflink":"https://www.tsijournals.com/articles/zika-virus-zikv--an-uncommon-zoonotic-virus.pdf","fulltextlink":null,"fullname":"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology Letters","journal":"tsbmbl","domain_name":"http://www.tsijournals.com/","art_type":"Review","abstract":"<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) remained a comparatively incomprehensible animal virus to us so far.

This article also focuses on recently reported complications of ZIKV infection together with Guillain-Barre syndrome and abnormality, potential interactions between ZIKV and break bone fever virus, and also the prospects for the event of antiviral agents and vaccines. Considering the recent outbreaks, it is important to increase the public awareness with more information related to the disease, symptoms, prevention and control.<\/p>","page_num":"","date":"2018-01-18","vol":"3","issue":"3","rel_keyword":"articles","journal_shortname":"Biochem Mol Biol"}]
